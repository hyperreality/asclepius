# Asclepius

Asclepius is a web-based patient and treatment management system developed by Laurence Tennant, Geraint Ballinger and Lucas Valtl for the Royal Free Hospital in London as part of the COMPGC02 "Apps Design" course taken at University College London.

The application is based on a variation of the [MEAN](https://github.com/meanjs/mean) framework. It replaces the MongoDB part of the framework with PostgreSQL using Sequelize as an ORM. Hence the app is entirely written in Javascript: SequelizeJS, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS.

You can find out more about the project and see it in action in this [video](https://youtu.be/0Im0chx2okg).
