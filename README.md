# Asclepius

Asclepius is a web-based patient and treatment management system developed by Laurence Tennant, Geraint Ballinger and Lucas Valtl for the Royal Free Hospital in London as part of the COMPGC02 "Apps Design" course taken at the University College London.

The application is based on a variation of the MEAN framework, it replaces the MongoDB part of the MEAN framework with SQL using sequelize. Hence the app is entirely written in javascript. It uses SequalizeJS, ExpressJS, AngularJS as well as NodeJS.

You can find out more about the project and see it in action in this [video](https://youtu.be/0Im0chx2okg).
